# 🪙 CryptoCurrency (Bitcoin) Price Prediction

This project is a **Flask web application** that predicts the future closing prices of cryptocurrencies (default: Bitcoin) using a **deep learning model (Keras LSTM)** trained on historical data from Yahoo Finance.

---

## ✨ **Features**

✅ Predicts future closing prices for a user-specified number of days
✅ Displays original vs predicted test data plots
✅ Generates future price trend plots
✅ Interactive web interface built using Flask
✅ Uses pre-trained Keras model for predictions

## 🚀 **Installation**

1. **Clone this repository:**

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install required packages:**

```bash
pip install pandas numpy yfinance keras scikit-learn matplotlib flask
```

---

## 📝 **Usage**

1. **Run the Flask app:**

```bash
python app.py
```

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. **Input:**

   * **Stock Ticker:** e.g. `BTC-USD` (default is Bitcoin)
   * **Number of days:** Number of future days to predict

4. **Output:**

   * Plot of historical closing prices
   * Comparison plot of original test data vs model predictions
   * Future closing price predictions plot

---

## 💡 **How It Works**

* Fetches 10 years of historical data from Yahoo Finance using **yfinance**
* Preprocesses data using **MinMaxScaler**
* Generates test data and performs predictions using the **pre-trained Keras model**
* Plots results with **Matplotlib** and embeds them in HTML using **base64 encoding**

---

## 🛠️ **Dependencies**

* Python 3.8+
* pandas
* numpy
* yfinance
* keras
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* flask

Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(You can create a `requirements.txt` using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*

---

## 📊 **Model Training**

The **Jupyter notebook** `CryptoCurrency(Bitcoin) Price Prediction.ipynb` contains:

* Data loading and visualization
* Data preprocessing and scaling
* Building and training the LSTM model
* Saving the model as `model.keras`

---

## 📌 **Notes**

* Model performance depends on training data and hyperparameters.
* Default ticker is `BTC-USD`, but you can use other crypto or stock tickers available on Yahoo Finance.
* Ensure internet connectivity for data fetching.
